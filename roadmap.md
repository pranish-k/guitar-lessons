# PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATIONS (Weeks 1-4)
## Understanding the Building Blocks of Music

---

## WEEK 1: Intervals - The DNA of Music

### What You'll Learn
Intervals are the distance between two notes. They're the fundamental building blocks of all music - every chord, scale, and melody is made of intervals. Understanding them unlocks everything else.

### Theory Concepts

**What is an Interval?**
An interval is simply the distance between two notes, measured in semitones (frets on guitar).

**The 12 Intervals You Need to Know:**
1. **Unison (0 semitones)** - Same note
2. **Minor 2nd (1 semitone)** - One fret apart
3. **Major 2nd (2 semitones)** - Two frets apart (whole step)
4. **Minor 3rd (3 semitones)** - Three frets apart
5. **Major 3rd (4 semitones)** - Four frets apart
6. **Perfect 4th (5 semitones)** - Five frets apart
7. **Tritone/Aug 4th (6 semitones)** - Six frets apart
8. **Perfect 5th (7 semitones)** - Seven frets apart
9. **Minor 6th (8 semitones)** - Eight frets apart
10. **Major 6th (9 semitones)** - Nine frets apart
11. **Minor 7th (10 semitones)** - Ten frets apart
12. **Major 7th (11 semitones)** - Eleven frets apart
13. **Octave (12 semitones)** - Twelve frets apart (same note, higher)

**Why "Perfect," "Major," and "Minor"?**
- **Perfect** intervals (unison, 4th, 5th, octave) sound very stable and consonant
- **Major** intervals sound bright and happy
- **Minor** intervals sound darker and more melancholic

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Single String Intervals (E String)**
Start on the open E string. Play each interval ascending:

```
Root (Open E)
Minor 2nd: 1st fret (F)
Major 2nd: 3rd fret (F#)
Minor 3rd: 3rd fret (G)
Major 3rd: 4th fret (G#)
Perfect 4th: 5th fret (A)
Tritone: 6th fret (A#)
Perfect 5th: 7th fret (B)
Minor 6th: 8th fret (C)
Major 6th: 9th fret (C#)
Minor 7th: 10th fret (D)
Major 7th: 11th fret (D#)
Octave: 12th fret (E)
```

Do this on every string. Say the interval name out loud as you play it.

**Exercise 2: Two-String Intervals**
The most musical way to play intervals is across strings. Here are the shapes:

**Perfect 5th (the power chord shape):**
```
E|---
B|---
G|---
D|---7---
A|---7---
E|---5---
```

**Major 3rd:**
```
E|---
B|---5---
G|---4---
D|---
A|---
E|---
```

**Perfect 4th:**
```
E|---
B|---
G|---5---
D|---5---
A|---
E|---
```

Practice finding each interval across all string pairs. Move them around the fretboard.

**Exercise 3: Interval Workout**
Pick a starting note (say, 5th fret A string = D). Play all 12 intervals from that note:
1. Root
2. Minor 2nd
3. Major 2nd
4. Minor 3rd
5. Major 3rd
... and so on

Do this from different starting positions each practice session.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Learn to recognize intervals by their sound. Each interval has a unique "flavor."

**Method: Song Association**
Associate each interval with a famous song you know:

1. **Minor 2nd** - Jaws theme (dum-DUM, dum-DUM)
2. **Major 2nd** - Happy Birthday (HAP-py)
3. **Minor 3rd** - Smoke on the Water riff, Greensleeves (opening)
4. **Major 3rd** - When the Saints Go Marching In (OH when the...)
5. **Perfect 4th** - Here Comes the Bride, Amazing Grace (a-MAZ-)
6. **Tritone** - The Simpsons theme, Black Sabbath
7. **Perfect 5th** - Star Wars theme, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
8. **Minor 6th** - The Entertainer (ragtime)
9. **Major 6th** - NBC chimes, My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean
10. **Minor 7th** - Star Trek theme
11. **Major 7th** - Take On Me (chorus: TAKE - on)
12. **Octave** - Somewhere Over the Rainbow (some-WHERE)

**Daily Ear Training Practice (10-15 minutes):**
1. Play an interval on your guitar
2. Sing it back
3. Try to name it
4. Check if you were right
5. Think of the song reference

**Online Tool:** Use musictheory.net/exercises/ear-interval or a phone app like "Perfect Ear" to test yourself.

## WEEK 2: The Major Scale - The Mother of All Scales

### What You'll Learn
The major scale is the foundation of Western music. Every other scale, every chord progression, every key signature comes from understanding this one scale. It's not just a pattern to memorize - it's a formula you can apply anywhere.

### Theory Concepts

**What is the Major Scale?**
The major scale is a specific pattern of intervals. It has 7 notes that always follow the same formula, then repeats at the octave.

**The Formula (in whole and half steps):**
W - W - H - W - W - W - H

Where:
- W = Whole step (2 frets)
- H = Half step (1 fret)

**Let's Build C Major Scale:**
Starting from C:
1. C (root)
2. W → D (2 frets up)
3. W → E (2 frets up)
4. H → F (1 fret up)
5. W → G (2 frets up)
6. W → A (2 frets up)
7. W → B (2 frets up)
8. H → C (1 fret up - back to octave)

**So C Major = C D E F G A B C**

**The Scale Degrees:**
Each note in the scale has a number and a name:
1. **1st - Root/Tonic** (C) - Home base
2. **2nd - Supertonic** (D)
3. **3rd - Mediant** (E) - Determines major/minor quality
4. **4th - Subdominant** (F)
5. **5th - Dominant** (G) - Second most important note
6. **6th - Submediant** (A)
7. **7th - Leading Tone** (B) - Wants to resolve to root

**The Intervals Within the Major Scale:**
From the root (1), the major scale contains:
- Root to 2nd = Major 2nd
- Root to 3rd = Major 3rd
- Root to 4th = Perfect 4th
- Root to 5th = Perfect 5th
- Root to 6th = Major 6th
- Root to 7th = Major 7th
- Root to octave = Octave

This is why it's called the "major" scale - it contains all the major intervals (plus the perfect ones).

**Building Any Major Scale:**
You can build a major scale from any note using the W-W-H-W-W-W-H formula.

**Example: G Major Scale**
Starting from G:
G - W - A - W - B - H - C - W - D - W - E - W - F# - H - G

**G Major = G A B C D E F# G**

Notice F is sharped (F#) to maintain the formula. This is why different keys have different sharps/flats.

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: The One-Octave Major Scale Shape (Positions 1-3)**

**Position 1: Starting on 6th String**
This is the most common major scale pattern. Let's use G Major (root on 3rd fret, low E string):

```
E|---2---3---5---
B|---3---5-------
G|---2---4---5---
D|---2---4---5---
A|---2---3---5---
E|---3---5-------
   G   A   B   etc.
```

**Position 2: Starting on 5th String**
C Major (root on 3rd fret, A string):

```
E|---0---1---3---
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2-------
D|---2---3-------
A|---3---5-------
E|---
   C   D   E   etc.
```

**Position 3: Starting on 4th String**
D Major (root on 5th fret, D string):

```
E|---2---3---5---
B|---2---3---5---
G|---2---4-------
D|---4---5-------
A|---5---
E|---
   D   E   F#  etc.
```

**Exercise 2: The Three-Note-Per-String Pattern**
This is the most efficient way to cover the fretboard. Here's G Major across all strings:

```
E|---2---3---5---
B|---3---5---6---
G|---2---4---5---
D|---2---4---5---
A|---2---3---5---
E|---3---5---6---
```

Practice ascending and descending. Say the note names as you play.

**Exercise 3: Building Scales from Any Root**
Pick a random note on the fretboard. Use the W-W-H-W-W-W-H formula to build a major scale from that note on a single string.

Example: Start on A (5th fret, E string)
```
A(5) - W - B(7) - W - C#(9) - H - D(10) - W - E(12) - W - F#(14) - W - G#(16) - H - A(17)
```

**Exercise 4: Scale Sequences**
Play the scale in different patterns to build fluency:

1. **Ascending and Descending:** 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
2. **Thirds:** 1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6, 5-7, 6-8, 7-8
3. **Fours:** 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, 3-4-5-6, etc.
4. **Skips:** 1-3-5-7, 2-4-6-8

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Internalize the sound of the major scale. It should sound "happy," "complete," and "resolved."

**Exercise 1: Sing the Scale**
Play the scale on guitar, then sing it back without the guitar. Use "do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do" (solfege) or just la-la-la.

**Exercise 2: Scale Degree Recognition**
1. Play the full scale ascending
2. Play the root note
3. Play a random scale degree
4. Try to identify which number it is (1-7)
5. Check yourself

**Exercise 3: Happy Birthday Analysis**
Happy Birthday is in the major scale. Play it on guitar and identify which scale degrees are being used:

"Happy birthday to you" = 5-5-6-5-1-7

Learning to hear scale degrees in familiar melodies is crucial.

**Exercise 4: Major Scale Sing-Along**
Find simple major-key songs (Twinkle Twinkle, Mary Had a Little Lamb, etc.) and play along with the major scale. Notice how every melody note fits within the scale.

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-25: Learn the theory - understand the formula, build C and G major
- Minutes 25-60: Exercises 1 & 2 - learn the scale shapes, play them cleanly
- Minutes 60-75: Ear training - sing the scale, play and sing back
- Minutes 75-90: Free exploration - find the major scale in a song you know

**Session 2:**
- Minutes 0-15: Review theory - rebuild scales from different roots
- Minutes 15-50: Exercises 3 & 4 - build scales on single strings, practice sequences
- Minutes 50-70: Ear training - scale degree recognition, analyze Happy Birthday
- Minutes 70-90: Application - improvise a simple melody using just major scale notes

## WEEK 3: Building Chords from Intervals

### What You'll Learn
Chords aren't random note combinations - they're built systematically from intervals. Once you understand the formula, you can build any chord, understand why it sounds the way it does, and even create your own voicings.

### Theory Concepts

**What is a Chord?**
A chord is three or more notes played simultaneously. The most fundamental chords are **triads** (three notes).

**The Triad Formula:**
Triads are built by stacking thirds (skipping every other note in the scale).

Starting from any root note:
- **Root** (1)
- Skip one note
- **Third** (3)
- Skip one note  
- **Fifth** (5)

**The Four Types of Triads:**

1. **Major Triad**
   - Formula: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th
   - Intervals from root: 0 - 4 - 7 semitones
   - Example: C Major = C + E + G
   - Sound: Happy, stable, bright

2. **Minor Triad**
   - Formula: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th
   - Intervals from root: 0 - 3 - 7 semitones
   - Example: C Minor = C + Eb + G
   - Sound: Sad, dark, melancholic

3. **Diminished Triad**
   - Formula: Root + Minor 3rd + Diminished 5th (flatted 5th)
   - Intervals from root: 0 - 3 - 6 semitones
   - Example: C Diminished = C + Eb + Gb
   - Sound: Tense, unstable, spooky

4. **Augmented Triad**
   - Formula: Root + Major 3rd + Augmented 5th (sharped 5th)
   - Intervals from root: 0 - 4 - 8 semitones
   - Example: C Augmented = C + E + G#
   - Sound: Dreamlike, floating, unresolved

**The Difference Between Major and Minor:**
The ONLY difference is the 3rd:
- Major 3rd (4 semitones) = Major chord
- Minor 3rd (3 semitones) = Minor chord

**Let's Build Chords from Scales:**

**C Major Scale: C D E F G A B C**

Building triads from each scale degree (stacking thirds):
1. C-E-G = **C major** (1-3-5 of C major scale)
2. D-F-A = **D minor** (1-3-5 of D dorian, but built from C major scale)
3. E-G-B = **E minor**
4. F-A-C = **F major**
5. G-B-D = **G major**
6. A-C-E = **A minor**
7. B-D-F = **B diminished**

**Notice the pattern:** In any major scale, the triads are:
- I = Major
- ii = minor
- iii = minor
- IV = Major
- V = Major
- vi = minor
- vii° = diminished

This pattern is the same in EVERY major key. This is huge - we'll use this in Week 5.

**Seventh Chords:**
Add one more third on top of a triad, and you get a seventh chord (four notes).

**Major 7th Chord:**
- Formula: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th + Major 7th
- Intervals: 0 - 4 - 7 - 11 semitones
- Example: Cmaj7 = C + E + G + B
- Sound: Jazzy, sophisticated, dreamy

**Dominant 7th Chord:**
- Formula: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th
- Intervals: 0 - 4 - 7 - 10 semitones
- Example: C7 = C + E + G + Bb
- Sound: Bluesy, wants to resolve, tension

**Minor 7th Chord:**
- Formula: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th
- Intervals: 0 - 3 - 7 - 10 semitones
- Example: Cm7 = C + Eb + G + Bb
- Sound: Smooth, mellow, jazzy

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Deconstructing Your Known Chords**

Take the open chords you already know and identify every note:

**C Major Chord:**
```
E|---0--- (E) = 3rd
B|---1--- (C) = Root
G|---0--- (G) = 5th
D|---2--- (E) = 3rd
A|---3--- (C) = Root
E|---X--- (not played)
```
Notes: C-E-G (Root-3rd-5th) = Major triad

**A Minor Chord:**
```
E|---0--- (E) = 5th
B|---1--- (C) = minor 3rd
G|---2--- (A) = Root
D|---2--- (E) = 5th
A|---0--- (A) = Root
E|---X---
```
Notes: A-C-E (Root-minor 3rd-5th) = Minor triad

Do this for every open chord you know: G, D, Em, Am, etc. Write down which note is the root, 3rd, and 5th.

**Exercise 2: Building Triads on the Top 3 Strings**

These are movable shapes. The root is marked with (R).

**Major Triad:**
```
E|---0---     E|---1---     E|---
B|---1---     B|---1---     B|---3---
G|---0---     G|---2---     G|---4---
    (R)          (5)          (3)
```

**Minor Triad:**
```
E|---0---     E|---1---     E|---
B|---0---     B|---1---     B|---3---
G|---0---     G|---2---     G|---3---
    (R)          (5)          (b3)
```

Practice these shapes all over the neck. Move them up and down, maintaining the same fingering.

**Exercise 3: The Major/Minor Experiment**

Pick any note on the guitar. Build a major triad. Then change ONLY the 3rd to make it minor. Hear the difference.

Example on A string, 5th fret (D root):
```
Major (D-F#-A):        Minor (D-F-A):
E|---5---             E|---5---
B|---7---             B|---6---  (lowered by 1 fret)
G|---7---             G|---7---
```

Do this exercise from 5 different root positions.

**Exercise 4: Seventh Chord Shapes**

**Dominant 7th (Moveable - root on 6th string):**
```
E|---1---
B|---1---
G|---2---
D|---1---
A|---3---
E|---1--- (R)
```
This is your E7 barre chord shape.

**Major 7th (Moveable - root on 6th string):**
```
E|---0---
B|---1---
G|---1---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---X---
```

**Minor 7th (Moveable - root on 5th string):**
```
E|---3---
B|---4---
G|---3---
D|---5---
A|---5--- (R)
E|---X---
```

Practice finding these shapes all over the neck.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Train your ear to distinguish major from minor, and to hear the quality of different chord types.

**Exercise 1: Major vs Minor Recognition**

1. Play a major chord
2. Play a minor chord (same root)
3. Close your eyes
4. Play one randomly
5. Try to identify which one it is

Start with open chords (C major vs. C minor, G major vs. G minor), then use moveable shapes.

**Exercise 2: Chord Quality Singing**

1. Play a major triad - sing the root, then the 3rd, then the 5th
2. Play a minor triad - sing the root, then the minor 3rd, then the 5th
3. Notice how you have to adjust your voice to hit the minor 3rd (it's lower)

**Exercise 3: Song Chord Analysis**

Pick 3 songs you know. For each chord in the song:
1. Is it major or minor?
2. What is the root note?
3. Are there any 7th chords?

Write it down. This connects ear training to real music.

**Exercise 4: The Emotion Test**

Play these progressions and notice the emotional difference:

**Major progression:**
C - F - G - C (all major)
Feeling: Bright, happy, resolved

**Minor progression:**
Am - Dm - E - Am (mostly minor)
Feeling: Dark, sad, introspective

**Mixed:**
C - Am - F - G
Feeling: Bittersweet, complex

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-25: Learn theory - understand triad formulas, build chords on paper
- Minutes 25-55: Exercise 1 & 2 - deconstruct known chords, learn triad shapes

## WEEK 4: The Fretboard - Complete Note Knowledge

### What You'll Learn
You already know E and A string notes up to the 12th fret. This week, you'll master the ENTIRE fretboard - all 6 strings, all 12 frets. This is the foundation for everything else. You can't truly improvise or understand music if you don't know what notes you're playing.

### Theory Concepts

**The Musical Alphabet:**
There are only 12 unique notes in Western music before they repeat at the octave:

**Natural Notes:** A - B - C - D - E - F - G
**Sharps/Flats:** A# (Bb) - C# (Db) - D# (Eb) - F# (Gb) - G# (Ab)

**Chromatic Scale (all 12 notes in order):**
A - A#/Bb - B - C - C#/Db - D - D#/Eb - E - F - F#/Gb - G - G#/Ab - (back to A)

**Important: No sharps/flats between B-C and E-F**
This is why there's no B# or E# in standard Western music.

**Enharmonic Equivalents:**
A# and Bb are the same note (same fret), just different names depending on musical context.
- Use sharps (#) when ascending: A - A# - B
- Use flats (b) when descending: B - Bb - A

**The Pattern on Guitar:**
Guitar frets are semitones (half steps). Moving up one fret = moving up one semitone in the chromatic scale.

**Octaves:**
The same note repeats every 12 frets (12 semitones = 1 octave).
- Open E = 12th fret E
- 3rd fret G (E string) = 15th fret G (E string)

### Guitar Application

**The Complete Fretboard Map:**

```
FRET:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12
E  |   E    F   F#    G   G#    A   A#    B    C   C#    D   D#    E
B  |   B    C   C#    D   D#    E    F   F#    G   G#    A   A#    B
G  |   G   G#    A   A#    B    C   C#    D   D#    E    F   F#    G
D  |   D   D#    E    F   F#    G   G#    A   A#    B    C   C#    D
A  |   A   A#    B    C   C#    D   D#    E    F   F#    G   G#    A
E  |   E    F   F#    G   G#    A   A#    B    C   C#    D   D#    E
```

**Exercise 1: Horizontal Learning (String by String)**

Master one string at a time, from open to 12th fret.

**Week 4 Focus: D, G, and B strings** (you already know E and A)

**D String:**
```
Open D - 1st Eb - 2nd E - 3rd F - 4th F# - 5th G - 6th G# - 7th A - 8th Bb - 9th B - 10th C - 11th C# - 12th D
```

Practice routine:
1. Play the string ascending, saying each note name out loud
2. Play descending
3. Random quiz: "Play F# on the D string" (answer: 4th fret)
4. Do this until you can name any fret instantly

Repeat for G and B strings.

**Exercise 2: Vertical Learning (Note by Note)**

Pick a note (let's say C) and find it on all 6 strings:

**All C notes:**
```
E  |---8---
B  |---1---
G  |---5---
D  |--10---
A  |---3---
E  |---8---
```

Do this for all 12 notes. Make flashcards if helpful:
- Front: "Find all G notes"
- Back: E(3), B(8), G(0), D(5), A(10), E(3)

**Exercise 3: Octave Shapes**

Learn the physical shapes that connect the same note on different strings:

**Shape 1: 6th to 4th string (2 frets up, 2 strings up)**
```
D  |---7--- (same note as...)
A  |---
E  |---5---
```

**Shape 2: 5th to 3rd string (2 frets up, 2 strings up)**
```
G  |---7---
D  |---
A  |---5---
```

**Shape 3: 4th to 2nd string (3 frets up, 2 strings up)**
Due to the guitar's tuning quirk (G-B is a major 3rd, not a 4th), this shape is different:
```
B  |---8---
G  |---
D  |---5---
```

**Shape 4: Adjacent strings (5 frets up, 1 string up)**
```
A  |---10---
E  |---5---
```

Practice finding octaves all over the fretboard using these shapes.

**Exercise 4: Landmark Notes**

Memorize key "landmark" notes that help you orient yourself:

**All E notes (your reference point):**
- Open E string
- 2nd fret D string
- 5th fret B string
- 9th fret G string
- 12th fret E string (octave)

**All A notes:**
- Open A string
- 2nd fret G string
- 5th fret E (high) string
- 7th fret D string
- 12th fret A string (octave)

**All C notes** (no open strings, so remember these):
- 1st fret B string
- 3rd fret A string
- 5th fret G string
- 8th fret E strings (both high and low)
- 10th fret D string

Use landmarks to triangulate other notes.

**Exercise 5: The Speed Drill**

Set a timer for 60 seconds:
1. Pick a random note (say, F#)
2. Play it on all 6 strings as fast as you can
3. Time yourself
4. Try to beat your time

Do this daily with a different note.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop relative pitch - the ability to identify notes in relation to a reference note.

**Exercise 1: Root Note Recognition**

1. Play a chord (any chord you know)
2. Find and play the root note
3. Sing that root note
4. Play the chord again
5. Verify you found the right root

Do this with 10 different chords per session.

**Exercise 2: Interval Ear Training (Review)**

Now that you know the fretboard better, revisit interval training from Week 1:
1. Pick any note on any string
2. Play an interval from that note
3. Name the interval
4. Sing it back
5. Verify on guitar

**Exercise 3: Note-by-Note Melody Learning**

Take a simple melody you know (Twinkle Twinkle, Happy Birthday):
1. Figure it out by ear on ONE string only
2. As you find each note, say its name out loud
3. Write down the note sequence
4. Play it on a different string
5. Play it in a different position

This connects your ear, your fretboard knowledge, and your musical memory.

**Exercise 4: Bass Note Listening**

Listen to a song with a clear bass line:
1. Try to identify the root notes of each chord by ear
2. Play along on your low E or A string
3. Name the notes you're playing

## Understanding How Music Works Together

## WEEK 5: Keys and Chord Families

### What You'll Learn
A "key" is the tonal center of a piece of music - the home base. Every key has a family of chords that belong to it, and understanding this unlocks how chord progressions work, why certain chords sound good together, and how to analyze any song.

### Theory Concepts

**What is a Key?**
A key is determined by which major (or minor) scale a piece of music is based on. When a song is "in the key of C major," it means:
- The C major scale provides all the notes
- C is the "tonal center" (home base)
- The chords are built from the C major scale

**The Diatonic Chords of a Key:**
Remember from Week 3: when you build triads from each degree of the major scale, you get a specific pattern.

**Key of C Major (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C):**

Building triads from each scale degree:
- **I - C major** (C-E-G) - The tonic, home base
- **ii - D minor** (D-F-A) - Subdominant function
- **iii - E minor** (E-G-B) - Mediant
- **IV - F major** (F-A-C) - Subdominant, very stable
- **V - G major** (G-B-D) - Dominant, wants to resolve to I
- **vi - A minor** (A-C-E) - Relative minor
- **vii° - B diminished** (B-D-F) - Leading tone, unstable

**The Roman Numeral System:**
- **Uppercase** = Major chord (I, IV, V)
- **Lowercase** = Minor chord (ii, iii, vi)
- **Lowercase with °** = Diminished chord (vii°)

This pattern is THE SAME in EVERY major key. Only the actual note names change.

**Key of G Major (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G):**
- **I - G major**
- **ii - A minor**
- **iii - B minor**
- **IV - C major**
- **V - D major**
- **vi - E minor**
- **vii° - F# diminished**

**Chord Functions:**

Chords have jobs within a key:

1. **Tonic (I, iii, vi)** - Stable, "home" feeling
   - **I** is the main tonic
   - **vi** (relative minor) can substitute for I

2. **Subdominant (ii, IV)** - "Departure" from home, builds tension
   - **IV** is the strongest subdominant
   - **ii** often leads to V

3. **Dominant (V, vii°)** - Maximum tension, wants to resolve to I
   - **V** is the strongest dominant
   - **V7** (dominant 7th) is even stronger

**Common Chord Progressions:**

The most common progressions in Western music:

**I - IV - V - I** (The most fundamental)
- In C: C - F - G - C
- Examples: Louie Louie, Wild Thing, La Bamba

**I - V - vi - IV** (The "pop" progression)
- In C: C - G - Am - F
- Examples: Let it Be, Don't Stop Believin', With or Without You, No Woman No Cry

**ii - V - I** (Jazz progression)
- In C: Dm - G - C
- Very smooth, strong resolution

**I - vi - IV - V** (50s progression)
- In C: C - Am - F - G
- Examples: Stand by Me, Every Breath You Take

**vi - IV - I - V** (Sensitive progression)
- In C: Am - F - C - G
- Examples: Zombie by The Cranberries

**How to Determine the Key of a Song:**

Method 1: **Look at the first and last chord** - Often the I chord
Method 2: **Find which major scale contains all the chords**
Method 3: **Listen for the "home" chord** - The one that feels resolved

Example: Song uses C, G, Am, F
- All these chords are in C major (I, V, vi, IV)
- C feels like "home"
- Therefore: Key of C major

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: The I-IV-V in Every Key**

Learn the I-IV-V progression in 5 common guitar keys:

**Key of C:**
- I = C (x32010)
- IV = F (133211)
- V = G (320003)

**Key of G:**
- I = G (320003)
- IV = C (x32010)
- V = D (xx0232)

**Key of D:**
- I = D (xx0232)
- IV = G (320003)
- V = A (x02220)

**Key of A:**
- I = A (x02220)
- IV = D (xx0232)
- V = E (022100)

**Key of E:**
- I = E (022100)
- IV = A (x02220)
- V = B (x24442)

Practice playing I-IV-V-I in each key. Listen to how similar they sound despite using different chords.

**Exercise 2: Building the Full Diatonic Set**

Pick a key (start with C) and play all 7 diatonic chords in order:

**C major:**
I - Cmaj / ii - Dm / iii - Em / IV - F / V - G / vi - Am / vii° - Bdim

Listen to the character of each chord. Notice how:
- I, IV, and V sound "strong" and stable
- ii, iii, vi sound softer
- vii° sounds unresolved and tense

**Exercise 3: Chord Progression Practice**

Learn these progressions in the key of C, then transpose to G and D:

**Progression 1: I - V - vi - IV**
C - G - Am - F (repeat)

**Progression 2: I - IV - V - I**
C - F - G - C

**Progression 3: vi - IV - I - V**
Am - F - C - G

**Progression 4: ii - V - I**
Dm - G - C

Strum each progression smoothly, focusing on clean chord changes.

**Exercise 4: Song Analysis**

Take 3 songs you know and analyze them:

**Example: "Let it Be" by The Beatles**
Progression: C - G - Am - F (repeats)
- Key: C major
- Numerals: I - V - vi - IV

**Your turn:** Pick 3 songs and write down:
1. What key are they in?
2. What is the chord progression in Roman numerals?
3. Which chords are major/minor?

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop functional hearing - the ability to hear chords in relation to the key.

**Exercise 1: Tonic Recognition**

1. Play a I-IV-V-I progression in any key
2. Stop on a random chord
3. Try to identify if you're on I, IV, or V
4. The I should feel like "home," V should feel like it wants to move

**Exercise 2: Common Progression Recognition**

Listen to songs and try to identify these patterns by ear:
- I-V-vi-IV (very common in pop)
- I-IV-V (rock and roll standard)
- vi-IV-I-V (emotional ballads)

Start with songs you know, then try new songs.

**Exercise 3: Bass Note Analysis**

Many songs emphasize the root note in the bass:
1. Listen to a song
2. Focus on the bass line
3. Play along on guitar (low strings only)
4. Identify the chord roots
5. Determine the key and progression

**Exercise 4: The Cadence Ear Test**

A cadence is how a progression resolves. Train your ear to recognize:

**Authentic Cadence (V-I):**
- Strongest resolution
- Sounds "complete"
- Play: G - C (in key of C)

**Plagal Cadence (IV-I):**
- "Amen" cadence
- Gentle resolution
- Play: F - C (in key of C)

**Deceptive Cadence (V-vi):**
- Unexpected
- Delays resolution
- Play: G - Am (in key of C)

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-25: Learn theory - understand keys, chord functions, Roman numerals
- Minutes 25-55: Exercise 1 & 2 - play I-IV-V in multiple keys, learn full diatonic set
- Minutes 55-75: Ear training - tonic recognition
- Minutes 75-90: Song analysis - analyze one song completely

**Session 2:**

## WEEK 6: The Minor Scale and Minor Keys

### What You'll Learn
So far, we've focused on major keys. But half of all music is in minor keys, which have a different emotional quality and different rules. Understanding minor scales and how they relate to major scales is crucial for complete musical literacy.

### Theory Concepts

**The Natural Minor Scale:**

The natural minor scale (also called Aeolian mode) has a different interval pattern than major:

**Formula: W - H - W - W - H - W - W**

Compare to Major: W - W - H - W - W - W - H

**Building A Natural Minor:**
A - W - B - H - C - W - D - W - E - H - F - W - G - W - A

**A natural minor = A B C D E F G A**

**The Three Types of Minor Scales:**

1. **Natural Minor** (Aeolian)
   - Formula: W-H-W-W-H-W-W
   - Example: A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A
   - Sound: Dark, melancholic, natural

2. **Harmonic Minor**
   - Natural minor with raised 7th
   - Example: A-B-C-D-E-F-G#-A
   - Sound: Exotic, Middle Eastern, classical
   - Used to create a strong dominant chord (E major in A minor)

3. **Melodic Minor**
   - Ascending: Natural minor with raised 6th and 7th
   - Descending: Pure natural minor
   - Ascending: A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#-A
   - Descending: A-G-F-E-D-C-B-A
   - Sound: Smooth, jazzy, sophisticated

**Relative Major and Minor:**

Every major key has a relative minor that shares the same notes (same key signature).

**The Rule:** The relative minor starts on the 6th degree of the major scale.

**C Major scale:** C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
- 6th degree = A
- **Relative minor: A minor**

Both C major and A minor use the same 7 notes (no sharps/flats), but:
- C major feels resolved on C
- A minor feels resolved on A

**Common Relative Pairs:**
- C major ↔ A minor
- G major ↔ E minor
- D major ↔ B minor
- A major ↔ F# minor
- E major ↔ C# minor

**The Minor Key Chord Family:**

Building triads from the natural minor scale (using A minor):

**A natural minor: A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A**

- **i - A minor** (A-C-E) - Tonic
- **ii° - B diminished** (B-D-F) - Unstable
- **III - C major** (C-E-G) - Relative major
- **iv - D minor** (D-F-A) - Subdominant
- **v - E minor** (E-G-B) - Minor dominant (weak resolution)
- **VI - F major** (F-A-C) - Strong, stable
- **VII - G major** (G-B-D) - Subtonic

**In harmonic minor** (raised 7th):
- **V becomes major** (E major: E-G#-B) - Much stronger resolution to i

**Minor Chord Functions:**

**Tonic:** i, III, VI
**Subdominant:** ii°, iv
**Dominant:** V (when using harmonic minor), VII

**Common Minor Progressions:**

**i - iv - V - i** (Harmonic minor)
- In A minor: Am - Dm - E - Am
- Examples: Stairway to Heaven intro

**i - VI - III - VII**
- In A minor: Am - F - C - G
- Examples: Zombie by Cranberries, All Along the Watchtower

**i - VII - VI - VII**
- In A minor: Am - G - F - G
- Examples: Sultans of Swing intro

**i - iv - VII - III**
- In E minor: Em - Am - D - G
- Examples: Losing My Religion by R.E.M.

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Natural Minor Scale Shapes**

Learn the natural minor scale in position (A minor starting on 5th fret):

**A Natural Minor (One Octave):**
```
E|---5---7---8---
B|---5---6---8---
G|---5---7-------
D|---5---7-------
A|---5---7---8---
E|---5----------- (A root)
```

**Three-Note-Per-String Pattern (A minor):**
```
E|---5---7---8---
B|---5---6---8---
G|---5---7---9---
D|---5---7---9---
A|---5---7---8---
E|---5---7---8---
```

Practice ascending and descending. Compare directly to A major scale - notice the differences (b3, b6, b7).

**Exercise 2: The Three Minor Scales Comparison**

Play all three types of minor scales starting from the same root (use E minor, open position):

**E Natural Minor:**
```
E|---0---2---3---
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2-------
D|---0---2-------
A|---0---2---3---
E|---0---2---3---
```

**E Harmonic Minor (raised 7th: D# instead of D):**
```
E|---0---2---4--- (D# on 4th fret instead of 3rd)
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2-------
D|---0---2-------
A|---0---2---3---
E|---0---2---3---
```

**E Melodic Minor Ascending (raised 6th and 7th: C# and D#):**
```
E|---0---2---4---
B|---0---2---3--- (C# on 2nd fret instead of 1st)
G|---0---2-------
D|---0---2-------
A|---0---2---3---
E|---0---2---3---
```

Play them back-to-back. Hear the subtle but important differences.

**Exercise 3: Relative Major/Minor Relationship**

Pick a major scale you know well. Find its relative minor (6th degree).

**Example: C Major ↔ A Minor**

**C Major scale (starting 8th fret E string):**
```
E|---8---10--12--
B|---8---10--12--
etc.
```

**A Minor scale (starting 5th fret E string - same notes, different tonal center):**
```
E|---5---7---8---
B|---5---6---8---
etc.
```

They use the exact same notes, just start in a different place. Play both and notice how the "feeling" changes based on which note feels like home.

**Exercise 4: Minor Chord Progressions**

Learn these progressions in E minor and A minor:

**Progression 1: i - iv - V (using harmonic minor for major V)**
- E minor: Em - Am - B - Em
- A minor: Am - Dm - E - Am

**Progression 2: i - VI - III - VII**
- E minor: Em - C - G - D
- A minor: Am - F - C - G

**Progression 3: i - VII - VI - VII (rock/metal)**
- E minor: Em - D - C - D
- A minor: Am - G - F - G

Strum each progression. Listen to how different they feel from major progressions.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop the ability to distinguish major from minor keys by ear, and recognize minor chord progressions.

**Exercise 1: Major vs Minor Key Recognition**

1. Play a major key progression: C - F - G - C
2. Play the relative minor progression: Am - Dm - E - Am
3. Shuffle them
4. Play one randomly
5. Identify if it's major or minor key

**The Difference:**
- Major = bright, happy, resolved
- Minor = dark, sad, tense

**Exercise 2: The Three Minor Scale Sounds**

Train your ear to hear the difference between the three minor types:

**Natural Minor:** Play A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A
- Sound: Smooth, natural, dark

**Harmonic Minor:** Play A-B-C-D-E-F-G#-A
- Sound: Exotic, distinctive raised 7th (G#) creates unique flavor

**Melodic Minor:** Play A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#-A
- Sound: Jazzy, ascending sounds "brighter"

Practice playing each, then play one randomly and identify which type.

**Exercise 3: Song Key Analysis**

Listen to songs and determine if they're in major or minor:

**Minor key examples:**
- "Stairway to Heaven" - Led Zeppelin (A minor)
- "Losing My Religion" - R.E.M. (F# minor)
- "Smells Like Teen Spirit" - Nirvana (F minor)
- "Zombie" - The Cranberries (E minor)

**Major key examples:**
- "Let it Be" - The Beatles (C major)
- "Sweet Home Alabama" - Lynyrd Skynyrd (D major)

Listen and identify: major or minor?

**Exercise 4: The i-V Resolution Ear Test**

In minor keys, the V chord often becomes major (harmonic minor) for a stronger resolution:

**Weak resolution (natural minor):**
Am - Em - Am (v minor to i minor)

**Strong resolution (harmonic minor):**
Am - E (major) - Am (V major to i minor)

Play both. Hear the difference. The major V creates more tension and a more satisfying resolution.

## WEEK 7: Introduction to Modes

### What You'll Learn
Modes are one of the most misunderstood topics in music theory, but they're actually quite simple once you grasp the core concept. They're alternate ways of hearing the major scale - different "flavors" that come from starting the scale on different degrees. Understanding modes unlocks new sonic possibilities and helps you understand how songs can have different moods using the same notes.

### Theory Concepts

**What Are Modes?**

Modes are scales derived from playing the major scale starting on different degrees.

**The 7 Modes of the Major Scale:**

Let's use C major (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C) to demonstrate:

1. **Ionian (1st degree)** - Start on C
   - C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
   - **This is just the major scale**
   - Character: Happy, bright, normal

2. **Dorian (2nd degree)** - Start on D
   - D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D
   - Formula from root: W-H-W-W-W-H-W
   - Character: Minor with a jazzy, sophisticated feel
   - Difference from natural minor: Raised 6th

3. **Phrygian (3rd degree)** - Start on E
   - E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E
   - Formula: H-W-W-W-H-W-W
   - Character: Dark, Spanish/flamenco, exotic
   - Difference from natural minor: Lowered 2nd

4. **Lydian (4th degree)** - Start on F
   - F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F
   - Formula: W-W-W-H-W-W-H
   - Character: Dreamy, ethereal, "floaty"
   - Difference from major: Raised 4th

5. **Mixolydian (5th degree)** - Start on G
   - G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G
   - Formula: W-W-H-W-W-H-W
   - Character: Bluesy, rock, upbeat but with edge
   - Difference from major: Lowered 7th

6. **Aeolian (6th degree)** - Start on A
   - A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A
   - **This is the natural minor scale**
   - Character: Dark, sad, melancholic

7. **Locrian (7th degree)** - Start on B
   - B-C-D-E-F-G-A-B
   - Formula: H-W-W-H-W-W-W
   - Character: Unstable, dissonant, rarely used
   - Difference: Diminished 5th (very unstable)

**The Key Insight:**

All 7 modes use the SAME NOTES as the parent major scale - they just start on different degrees and emphasize different notes as the tonal center.

**C Major scale notes:** C-D-E-F-G-A-B
- **C Ionian** emphasizes C as root
- **D Dorian** emphasizes D as root
- **E Phrygian** emphasizes E as root
... and so on.

**Why Modes Matter:**

Modes allow you to:
1. Create different moods with the same notes
2. Understand why certain chord progressions feel different
3. Improvise with different flavors over the same backing chords
4. Analyze songs more deeply

**Practical Mode Usage:**

**Most Common in Modern Music:**
- **Dorian:** Minor with a brighter sound (Scarborough Fair, Oye Como Va)
- **Mixolydian:** Rock/blues sound (Sweet Child O' Mine, Norwegian Wood)
- **Aeolian:** Standard minor (most minor songs use this)

**Less Common but Still Used:**
- **Phrygian:** Spanish/metal music (flamenco, some Metallica)
- **Lydian:** Dreamy soundtracks (The Simpsons theme, Joe Satriani)

**Mode vs. Key:**

**Key** = Which notes are available (the collection of notes)
**Mode** = Which note feels like "home" within that collection

Example:
- "Key of C major" and "D Dorian" both use C-D-E-F-G-A-B
- But C major feels resolved on C, while D Dorian feels resolved on D

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Playing the 7 Modes from One Root**

The clearest way to understand modes: play them all starting from the same note.

**All modes starting on E (open position):**

**E Ionian (E Major):**
```
E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D#-E
E|---0---2---4---
B|---0---2---4---
G|---1---2---4---
etc.
```

**E Dorian:**
```
E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D-E (minor 3rd, major 6th)
E|---0---2---3---
B|---0---2---3---
G|---1---2---4---
```

**E Phrygian:**
```
E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E (minor 2nd, minor 3rd)
E|---0---1---3---
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2---4---
```

**E Lydian:**
```
E-F#-G#-A#-B-C#-D#-E (augmented 4th)
E|---0---2---4---
B|---0---2---4---
G|---1---3---4---
```

**E Mixolydian:**
```
E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E (major 3rd, minor 7th)
E|---0---2---4---
B|---0---2---3---
G|---1---2---4---
```

**E Aeolian (E Natural Minor):**
```
E-F#-G-A-B-C-D-E
E|---0---2---3---
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2---4---
```

**E Locrian:**
```
E-F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E (diminished 5th)
E|---0---1---3---
B|---0---1---3---
G|---0---2---3--- (b5)
```

Play each mode from E. Listen to how each has a unique character despite starting on the same note.

**Exercise 2: Modal Patterns from C Major**

Play the modes as they naturally occur in C major:

**C Ionian:** C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (8th fret)
**D Dorian:** D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D (10th fret)
**E Phrygian:** E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E (12th fret)
**F Lydian:** F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F (1st fret or 13th fret)
**G Mixolydian:** G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G (3rd fret or 15th fret)
**A Aeolian:** A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A (5th fret)
**B Locrian:** B-C-D-E-F-G-A-B (7th fret)

This exercise shows you how all modes are connected on the fretboard.

**Exercise 3: The "Characteristic Note" Approach**

Each mode has ONE note that distinguishes it from major or minor. Focus on that note:

**Dorian's characteristic note:** Raised 6th (compared to natural minor)
- Play A minor scale, then raise the 6th (F → F#) = A Dorian

**Mixolydian's characteristic note:** Lowered 7th (compared to major)
- Play G major scale, then lower the 7th (F# → F) = G Mixolydian

**Phrygian's characteristic note:** Lowered 2nd (compared to natural minor)
- Play E minor scale, then lower the 2nd (F# → F) = E Phrygian

Practice isolating and emphasizing the characteristic note when you play each mode.

**Exercise 4: Modal Chord Progressions**

Learn progressions that emphasize different modes:

**Dorian progression (D Dorian):**
Dm - G - Dm (emphasizes the major IV chord, which contains the raised 6th)

**Mixolydian progression (G Mixolydian):**
G - F - C - G (the F major chord emphasizes the b7)

**Phrygian progression (E Phrygian):**
Em - F - Em (the F major chord right next to Em is very characteristic)

Play these progressions and notice how they don't sound like typical major or minor.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop the ability to hear the unique character of each mode.

**Exercise 1: Mode Recognition (Major vs. Mixolydian)**

These two modes are very similar, but Mixolydian has a b7:

**Play C Major scale:** C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (bright, happy)
**Play C Mixolydian:** C-D-E-F-G-A-Bb-C (bluesy, rock)

The Bb (b7) gives it that characteristic "rock" sound. Practice switching between them and hearing the difference.

**Exercise 2: Mode Recognition (Minor vs. Dorian)**

**Play A Natural Minor:** A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A (dark)
**Play A Dorian:** A-B-C-D-E-F#-G-A (jazzier, brighter minor)

The F# (raised 6th) brightens the sound. Listen to the difference.

**Exercise 3: Modal Song Examples**

Train your ear using famous modal songs:

**Dorian:**
- "Scarborough Fair" - Simon & Garfunkel
- "Oye Como Va" - Santana
- "So What" - Miles Davis

**Mixolydian:**
- "Sweet Child O' Mine" - Guns N' Roses (verse)
- "Norwegian Wood" - The Beatles
- "Tequila" - The Champs

**Phrygian:**
- "White Rabbit" - Jefferson Airplane (first note)
- Many flamenco pieces

**Lydian:**
- "The Simpsons" theme
- "Flying in a Blue Dream" - Joe Satriani

Listen to these songs. Try to identify which mode they're in based on the characteristic sound.

**Exercise 4: Drone Note + Scale Practice**

This is the BEST way to internalize modes:

1. Set up a drone note (use a looper pedal, or find a drone backing track on YouTube)
2. Play a mode over that drone
3. Let each note ring and hear how it relates to the drone

Example: Drone on D, play D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D)
- The F natural (minor 3rd) and B natural (major 6th) are the key colors

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-30: Learn theory - understand what modes are, how they're derived
- Minutes 30-60: Exercise 1 - play all 7 modes starting from E
- Minutes 60-75: Ear training - major vs Mixolydian recognition
- Minutes 75-90: Free exploration - play modes, listen to their colors

**Session 2:**
- Minutes 0-20: Review theory - quiz yourself on mode formulas
- Minutes 20-50: Exercise 2 & 3 - modal patterns from C major, characteristic note approach
- Minutes 50-70: Ear training - minor vs Dorian, modal song examples
- Minutes 70-90: Application - learn a modal song (e.g., Scarborough Fair)

**Session 3:**
- Minutes 0-20: Exercise 4 - modal chord progressions
- Minutes 20-50: Practice progressions, emphasize characteristic notes
- Minutes 50-75: Ear training - drone note + scale practice
- Minutes 75-90: Integration - improvise using different modes over a backing track

### Checkpoint
By the end of Week 7, you should be able to:
- [ ] Name all 7 modes in order
- [ ] Explain what a mode is (major scale starting on different degrees)
- [ ] Play at least 3 modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, Aeolian) from any root
- [ ] Identify the characteristic note of each mode
- [ ] Hear the difference between major/Mixolydian and minor/Dorian
- [ ] Understand that modes are about the tonal center, not just the notes

### Important Note on Modes

Modes are a HUGE topic, and this week only scratches the surface. The goal isn't mastery - it's **awareness**. You now know modes exist, how they're built, and how they sound different from standard major/minor. As you progress, you'll naturally deepen your modal understanding.

Don't get paralyzed by modes. Focus on Dorian and Mixolydian for now - they're the most practical.

**Analysis Template:**

**Song:** _______________
**Artist:** _______________

1. **Key:** What key is it in? (Major or minor?)
2. **Scale:** What scale is being used? (Major, natural minor, mode?)
3. **Chord Progression:** Write it out in both:
   - Actual chords: (e.g., C - Am - F - G)
   - Roman numerals: (e.g., I - vi - IV - V)
4. **Chord Construction:** Pick 3 chords and identify the root, 3rd, 5th
5. **Melody:** Can you identify the scale degrees of the melody?
6. **Intervals:** What intervals are prominent in the melody?

**Task 1: Create a progression in C major using:**
- The I, IV, and vi chords (at minimum)
- At least 4 chords
- Make it resolve back to I

**Task 2: Create a minor progression in Am using:**
- The i and iv chords
- The major V (from harmonic minor)
- At least 4 chords total

**Task 3: Create a modal progression:**
- Choose D Dorian
- Emphasize the characteristic major 6th (B natural)

- Improvise using ONLY the C major scale
- Focus on starting and ending phrases on the root (C)
- Duration: 5 minutes

**Level 2: Chord Tone Targeting**
- Same backing track
- When each chord plays, emphasize the notes of that chord
- Example: Over C major chord, focus on C-E-G notes
- Duration: 5 minutes

**Level 3: Modal Flavor**
- Pick a Dorian backing track (e.g., "D Dorian backing track")
- Use D Dorian scale (D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D)
- Emphasize the characteristic note (B natural, the major 6th)
- Duration: 5 minutes

**Exercise 5: Ear Training Integration**

Connect your ear to your theory knowledge:

**Challenge 1: Progression Dictation**
- Listen to a simple song
- Write down the chord progression by ear
- Then identify it using Roman numerals
- Finally, verify you were correct

**Challenge 2: Interval Singing**

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"I still can't find notes on the fretboard quickly enough"**
→ Go back to Week 4. Do the speed drills daily for 10 minutes. It takes time.

**"Modes still confuse me"**
→ That's normal. Focus only on Dorian and Mixolydian for now. Modes take months/years to truly master.

**"I can't hear intervals yet"**
→ Keep using song references from Week 1. Test yourself with an app daily. Ear training is the slowest skill to develop.

**"Theory feels separate from playing"**
→ This integration week should help. Always connect theory to real songs you love.

**"I'm overwhelmed"**
→ You've learned a LOT. It's okay to slow down. Focus on what interests you most.

### Moving Forward

You've completed 8 weeks of intensive music theory and guitar study. You now have a foundation that most guitarists never build.

**What's next?** (Weeks 9-12 preview)

**Week 9:** Advanced chord progressions and substitutions
**Week 10:** Improvisation techniques and soloing strategies
**Week 11:** Rhythm and groove - applying theory to rhythm guitar
**Week 12:** Creating your own music - composition basics

But before moving forward, make sure you're solid on Weeks 1-8. If needed, take an extra week to review and strengthen weak areas.

## WEEK 9: Advanced Chord Progressions and Substitutions

### What You'll Learn
Now that you understand how chords function within a key, it's time to get creative. This week you'll learn how to make chord progressions more interesting through substitutions, extensions, and borrowed chords. This is where theory becomes art.

### Theory Concepts

**Chord Substitution Basics:**

Chords can often be substituted for each other when they share similar functions or common tones.

**1. Functional Substitution (Same Family)**

Chords with similar functions can substitute for each other:

**Tonic substitutes (I, iii, vi):**
- I can be replaced by vi (very common)
- Example in C: C major → A minor
- Sound: Softens the progression, adds melancholy

**Subdominant substitutes (ii, IV):**
- IV can be replaced by ii
- Example in C: F major → D minor
- Sound: Makes it jazzier, smoother

**Dominant substitutes (V, vii°):**
- V can be replaced by vii° (rarely used)
- Example in C: G major → B diminished

**2. Relative Major/Minor Substitution**

The iii chord can substitute for I (shares 2 out of 3 notes):
- C major (C-E-G) → E minor (E-G-B)
- Common notes: E and G

**3. Secondary Dominants**

"Borrowing" the V chord from another key to create tension.

**Example in C major:**
- Normal: Dm (ii) → G (V) → C (I)
- With secondary dominant: **A7 (V of Dm)** → Dm → G → C

The A7 chord doesn't belong to C major (it has C#), but it functions as the V of D minor, creating extra tension that resolves to Dm.

**Common secondary dominants:**
- **V/ii:** A7 in key of C (leading to Dm)
- **V/iii:** B7 in key of C (leading to Em)
- **V/IV:** C7 in key of C (leading to F)
- **V/V:** D7 in key of C (leading to G)
- **V/vi:** E7 in key of C (leading to Am)

**4. Modal Interchange (Borrowed Chords)**

Borrowing chords from the parallel minor key.

**In C major, you can borrow from C minor:**

**C minor chords:** Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb

**Common borrowed chords in major:**
- **bVII** (Bb in C major) - Very common in rock
  - Example: C - Bb - F - C
- **bVI** (Ab in C major) - Adds darkness
  - Example: C - Ab - Bb - C
- **iv** (Fm in C major) - Sad but beautiful
  - Example: C - Am - Fm - G

**5. Tritone Substitution**

Replace a dominant chord with another dominant chord a tritone (6 semitones) away.

**Example:**
- Instead of G7 → C
- Use Db7 → C

Why it works: G7 (G-B-D-F) and Db7 (Db-F-Ab-Cb) share the same tritone (B-F), which creates the tension.

**Common in jazz, less common in rock/pop.**

**Chord Extensions:**

Adding notes beyond the basic triad creates richer harmonies.

**7th Chords (already covered):**
- Major 7th: Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B)
- Dominant 7th: C7 (C-E-G-Bb)
- Minor 7th: Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb)

**9th Chords:**
- Add the 9th (which is the 2nd an octave up)
- Cmaj9: C-E-G-B-D
- C9: C-E-G-Bb-D (dominant)
- Cm9: C-Eb-G-Bb-D

**11th and 13th Chords:**
- Add even more color
- Used heavily in jazz, less in pop/rock

**Suspended Chords:**

Replace the 3rd with either the 2nd or 4th.

**sus2:** Replace 3rd with 2nd
- Csus2: C-D-G (instead of C-E-G)
- Sound: Open, ambiguous, neither major nor minor

**sus4:** Replace 3rd with 4th
- Csus4: C-F-G (instead of C-E-G)
- Sound: Tension that wants to resolve to major

**Add Chords:**

Keep the 3rd but add another note:

**add9:** Add the 9th while keeping the 3rd
- Cadd9: C-E-G-D
- Sound: Rich, full, modern

**Slash Chords (Bass Note Changes):**

Play a chord with a different bass note:

**C/E:** C major chord with E in the bass
**C/G:** C major chord with G in the bass

This creates smooth bass lines and voice leading.

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Substitution Practice**

Take a basic progression and substitute chords:

**Original:** C - F - G - C (I - IV - V - I)

**Substitution 1:** C - Dm - G - C (replace IV with ii)
**Substitution 2:** C - F - G - Am (replace I at end with vi - deceptive cadence)
**Substitution 3:** C - F - Em - Am (replace V with iii)

Play each version. Hear how the substitutions change the mood.

**Exercise 2: Secondary Dominants**

Add secondary dominants to create more motion:

**Basic progression:** Dm - G - C

**With secondary dominant:** A7 - Dm - G - C
(A7 is V/ii, leading strongly to Dm)

**Another example:**
**Basic:** Em - Am - Dm - G
**Enhanced:** B7 - Em - E7 - Am - A7 - Dm - G

Learn these shapes:

**A7:**
```
E|---0---
B|---2---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---0---
E|---
```

**B7:**
```
E|---2---
B|---0---
G|---2---
D|---1---
A|---2---
E|---
```

**E7:**
```
E|---0---
B|---0---
G|---1---
D|---0---
A|---2---
E|---0---
```

**Exercise 3: Borrowed Chords**

Practice modal interchange:

**C major with borrowed bVII:**
C - Bb - F - C

**Bb major chord:**
```
E|---1---
B|---3---
G|---3---
D|---3---
A|---1---
E|---
```

**C major with borrowed iv (minor 4):**
C - Fm - G - C

**Fm chord:**
```
E|---1---
B|---1---
G|---1---
D|---3---
A|---3---
E|---1---
```

Notice how these borrowed chords add emotional depth.

**Exercise 4: Chord Extensions**

Learn extended chord voicings:

**Cmaj7:**
```
E|---0---
B|---0---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---
```

**Cmaj9:**
```
E|---0---
B|---3---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---
```

**Cadd9:**
```
E|---3---
B|---3---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---
```

**Csus2:**
```
E|---3---
B|---3---
G|---0---
D|---0---
A|---3---
E|---
```

**Csus4:**
```
E|---3---
B|---3---
G|---0---
D|---3---
A|---3---
E|---
```

Practice progressions using these colors:

**Progression 1:** Cmaj7 - Am7 - Fmaj7 - G7
**Progression 2:** Cadd9 - Dsus4 - Em7 - G
**Progression 3:** Cmaj9 - Dm9 - G9 - Cmaj9

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop the ear to recognize when substitutions and extensions are being used in songs.

**Exercise 1: Deceptive Cadence Recognition**

Train your ear to hear when V doesn't go to I:

**Expected (Authentic Cadence):** G - C (V - I) - sounds complete
**Deceptive:** G - Am (V - vi) - sounds like a "fake out"

Play both. The deceptive cadence surprises the ear.

**Songs with deceptive cadences:**
- "God Only Knows" - The Beach Boys (uses deceptive cadences throughout)

**Exercise 2: Extension Recognition**

Compare basic triads to 7th and 9th chords:

**Play:** C major triad
**Then play:** Cmaj7
**Then play:** Cmaj9

Hear how each adds more "color" and sophistication.

**Exercise 3: Borrowed Chord Ear Training**

**Play in C major:**
C - F - G - C (all diatonic, bright)

**Then play:**
C - Fm - G - C (borrowed iv from parallel minor)

The Fm adds a touch of sadness. Train your ear to recognize when chords don't quite fit the key.

**Exercise 4: Song Analysis for Substitutions**

Pick 2-3 songs and analyze for:
- Secondary dominants
- Borrowed chords
- Chord extensions
- Substitutions

**Example: "Something" by The Beatles**
Uses lots of secondary dominants and borrowed chords throughout.

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

## WEEK 10: Improvisation - Soloing with Intent

### What You'll Learn
Improvisation is the ultimate test of musical understanding. It's where theory, technique, and creativity meet. This week, you'll learn frameworks for improvising melodically and expressively - not just running scales, but telling a musical story.

### Theory Concepts

**What is Improvisation?**

Improvisation is spontaneous musical creation. It's not random - it's applying your knowledge of scales, chords, and musical phrasing in real-time to create melodies.

**The Foundation: Chord Tone Soloing**

The strongest notes you can play over any chord are the chord tones themselves (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th).

**Example: Over a C major chord (C-E-G):**
- Strongest notes: C, E, G
- Passing tones: D, F, A, B (from C major scale)

**The Hierarchy of Note Strength:**
1. **Root** - Most stable, always sounds "right"
2. **5th** - Very stable
3. **3rd** - Defines major/minor quality
4. **7th** (if present) - Adds color
5. **Scale tones** - Generally safe
6. **Non-scale tones** - Use sparingly for tension

**Approach: Target chord tones on strong beats**

When the chord changes, aim to land on a chord tone at the moment of change.

**Example progression: C - Am - F - G**

Over C: Target C, E, or G
Over Am: Target A, C, or E
Over F: Target F, A, or C
Over G: Target G, B, or D

**Pentatonic Scales - The Soloist's Best Friend**

The pentatonic scale removes the two "problem notes" from the major scale, making it nearly impossible to play a "wrong" note.

**Major Pentatonic Formula: 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 6**

**C Major Pentatonic:** C - D - E - G - A
(Removes F and B from C major scale)

**Minor Pentatonic Formula: 1 - b3 - 4 - 5 - b7**

**A Minor Pentatonic:** A - C - D - E - G
(Removes B and F from A natural minor)

**Key Insight:** The A minor pentatonic and C major pentatonic use the SAME NOTES (relative relationship).

**Blues Scale**

Add one note to minor pentatonic (the b5, or "blue note"):

**A Blues Scale:** A - C - D - Eb - E - G

The Eb (b5) adds that characteristic "bluesy" tension.

**Phrasing - The Secret to Musical Improvisation**

Think of improvisation like speaking:
- **Phrases** = Musical sentences
- **Rests** = Punctuation
- **Dynamics** = Emphasis

**Good phrasing principles:**
1. **Play in short phrases** - 2-4 bars, then rest
2. **Use space** - Silence is as important as sound
3. **Build tension and release** - Start simple, build complexity, resolve
4. **Repeat ideas** - Play a motif, then vary it
5. **Sing what you play** - If you can't sing it, don't play it

**Call and Response**

Play a phrase (the "question"), then answer it (the "response"):

**Example:**
- Call: Play ascending line over C
- Response: Play descending line over G
- Resolution: Land on C

**Rhythmic Variation**

Don't just play eighth notes non-stop. Vary your rhythm:
- Quarter notes (slow)
- Eighth notes (medium)
- Sixteenth notes (fast runs)
- Triplets (flowing)
- Syncopation (off-beat accents)

**Target Notes and Approach Notes**

**Target note:** The note you want to emphasize (usually a chord tone)
**Approach note:** The note just before it (creates tension)

**Example over C major:**
Target: E (3rd of C)
Approach from below: D (whole step below)
Approach from above: F (half step above)

This creates melodic interest and direction.

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Chord Tone Targeting**

Use a simple progression: C - F - G - C

**Step 1:** Play ONLY chord tones (no scale runs)
- Over C: Play C, E, or G
- Over F: Play F, A, or C
- Over G: Play G, B, or D

**Step 2:** Connect chord tones with passing notes
- C (chord tone) → D (passing) → E (chord tone)

**Step 3:** Add rhythmic variation
- Hold some notes longer, play some faster

This is the foundation of melodic improvisation.

**Exercise 2: Pentatonic Box Patterns**

**Minor Pentatonic (Pattern 1 - Root on 6th string):**

**A Minor Pentatonic (5th position):**
```
E|---5---8---
B|---5---8---
G|---5---7---
D|---5---7---
A|---5---7---
E|---5---8---
```

Practice this shape until it's effortless. Then:
1. Play ascending
2. Play descending
3. Skip strings (E string to G string, etc.)
4. Play in sequences (1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, etc.)

**Exercise 3: Blues Scale with Bends**

The blues scale + bending = classic rock/blues soloing.

**A Blues Scale:**
```
E|---5---8---
B|---5---6---8---
G|---5---6---7---
D|---5---7---
A|---5---7---
E|---5---8---
```

**Bending the b5 (6th fret G string) up to the 5 (7th fret):**
This is THE classic blues lick. Practice bending accurately.

**Exercise 4: Call and Response Practice**

Set up a looper or backing track (Am backing track):

**Round 1:**
- Play a 2-bar phrase (the "call")
- Rest for 2 bars
- Play a response (the "answer")
- Rest for 2 bars

**Round 2:**
- Play the same call
- Play a DIFFERENT response

**Round 3:**
- Vary the call
- Create a new response

This develops phrasing and musical conversation.

**Exercise 5: Motif Development**

A motif is a short musical idea that you develop:

**Step 1:** Create a 3-4 note motif
Example: C - D - E - G

**Step 2:** Repeat it exactly

**Step 3:** Vary it:
- Change rhythm (play it faster/slower)
- Transpose it (play it starting on D instead of C)
- Invert it (play it backwards: G - E - D - C)
- Extend it (add notes: C - D - E - G - A)

This is how professional solos are constructed - they develop ideas, not just run scales.

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop the ability to play what you hear in your head.

**Exercise 1: Sing Then Play**

1. Sing a simple melody (Happy Birthday, Twinkle Twinkle, etc.)
2. Figure it out on guitar by ear
3. Analyze: What scale degrees did you use?

**Exercise 2: Transcription Practice**

Pick a simple guitar solo (e.g., "Sunshine of Your Love" by Cream):
1. Listen to one phrase (2-4 bars)
2. Figure it out by ear
3. Write down the notes
4. Analyze: What scale? What chord tones?

Start with simple, slow solos. Work up to faster, more complex ones.

**Exercise 3: Chord Tone Ear Training**

1. Play a chord (any chord)
2. Sing the root
3. Sing the 3rd
4. Sing the 5th
5. Play them on guitar to verify

This trains your ear to hear chord tones, which you can then target in improvisation.

**Exercise 4: Imitation Game**

1. Play a short phrase (4-6 notes)
2. Sing it back immediately
3. Play it again to verify

If you can sing it, you've internalized it. If you can't, you're just playing patterns.

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-25: Learn theory - chord tone soloing, pentatonic scales
- Minutes 25-55: Exercise 1 & 2 - chord tone targeting, pentatonic patterns
- Minutes 55-75: Ear training - sing then play
- Minutes 75-90: Free improvisation over backing track (focus on chord tones)

**Session 2:**
- Minutes 0-20: Review theory - blues scale, phrasing concepts
- Minutes 20-50: Exercise 3 & 4 - blues scale with bends, call and response
- Minutes 50-70: Ear training - transcription practice
- Minutes 70-90: Application - learn a simple solo by ear

**Session 3:**
- Minutes 0-25: Exercise 5 - motif development
- Minutes 25-55: Practice improvising with motifs over backing track
- Minutes 55-75: Ear training - chord tone ear training, imitation game
- Minutes 75-90: Integration - record yourself improvising, listen back critically

### Checkpoint
By the end of Week 10, you should be able to:
- [ ] Target chord tones when improvising
- [ ] Play minor pentatonic in at least one position
- [ ] Use the blues scale with bends
- [ ] Phrase musically (using space, call and response)
- [ ] Develop a motif through variation
- [ ] Transcribe simple melodies by ear
- [ ] Improvise a short solo that sounds musical (not just scales)

### Important Mindset for Improvisation

**Improvisation is NOT about:**
- Playing as many notes as possible
- Running scales up and down
- Showing off technique

**Improvisation IS about:**
- Musical expression
- Telling a story
- Connecting with the listener
- Making intentional choices

Focus on playing fewer notes more meaningfully rather than many notes without purpose.

## WEEK 11: Rhythm & Groove - The Foundation of Music

### What You'll Learn
Rhythm is often overlooked by guitarists who focus only on lead playing, but rhythm is the heartbeat of music. Great rhythm playing is about more than strumming chords - it's about groove, dynamics, and locking in with the pulse. This week, you'll develop rhythmic precision and musicality.

### Theory Concepts

**Rhythm Fundamentals:**

**Beat:** The steady pulse of music (what you tap your foot to)
**Tempo:** How fast the beats occur (measured in BPM - beats per minute)
**Meter:** How beats are organized into groups (time signature)

**Common Time Signatures:**

**4/4 (Common Time):**
- 4 beats per measure
- Quarter note gets one beat
- Most rock, pop, blues

**3/4 (Waltz Time):**
- 3 beats per measure
- Quarter note gets one beat
- Waltz, some ballads

**6/8:**
- 6 beats per measure (but felt as 2 big beats, each divided into 3)
- Eighth note gets one beat
- Some blues, ballads

**Note Values:**

**Whole note:** 4 beats (in 4/4)
**Half note:** 2 beats
**Quarter note:** 1 beat
**Eighth note:** 1/2 beat
**Sixteenth note:** 1/4 beat

**Rests:** Silence is part of rhythm. Each note value has an equivalent rest.

**Syncopation:**

Playing notes on the off-beats (the "ands" between beats):

**Straight rhythm:** 1 2 3 4 (on the beat)
**Syncopated:** 1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and (emphasizing the "ands")

Syncopation creates groove and makes rhythm interesting.

**Strumming Patterns:**

**Basic Pattern (Down strums only):**
```
1   2   3   4
D   D   D   D
```

**Down-Up Pattern:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D U D U D U D U
```

**Syncopated Pattern:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D U   U D U
```

**Dynamics in Rhythm:**

**Accent:** Play a note/strum louder than others (indicated by >)

**Example:**
```
1   2   3   4
>       >
```
Accents on 1 and 3 (typical rock pattern)

**Palm Muting:**

Resting the heel of your picking hand lightly on the strings near the bridge creates a muted, percussive sound. Great for rhythmic playing.

**Reggae/Ska upstroke accent:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    >   >   >
    U   U   U
```
Emphasize the off-beats (2 and, 3 and, 4 and)

**Chord Progressions and Rhythm:**

The same chord progression can sound completely different based on rhythm:

**Progression: C - Am - F - G**

**Rock feel:** Heavy downstrokes, accents on 1 and 3
**Reggae feel:** Upstrokes on off-beats, light and bouncy
**Ballad feel:** Arpeggiated (one note at a time), slow and spacious

**Groove:**

Groove is the rhythmic feel that makes music move. It's about:
1. **Consistency** - Staying locked to the tempo
2. **Pocket** - Playing slightly ahead of, on, or behind the beat for feel
3. **Dynamics** - Varying volume and intensity
4. **Space** - Knowing when NOT to play

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Metronome Training**

**Why:** The metronome is your best friend for developing timing.

**Step 1: Basic Downstrokes**
- Set metronome to 60 BPM
- Play a C chord
- Strum down on every beat (1-2-3-4)
- Focus: Every strum exactly on the click

**Step 2: Down-Up Pattern**
- Same tempo
- Strum down on the beat, up on the "and"
- 1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and

**Step 3: Eighth Note Strumming**
- Increase tempo to 80 BPM
- Continuous down-up strumming
- Stay relaxed and consistent

**Step 4: Rhythmic Variation**
- 80 BPM
- Play this pattern:
```
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
D       D   U       U   D   U
```
- Repeat until it's automatic

**Exercise 2: The Funk Strum**

Funk rhythm is all about syncopation and dead strums (muted strums for percussive effect).

**Pattern:**
```
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
D   X   D   X       X   D   U
```
X = dead strum (mute strings with fretting hand, strum for percussive sound)

**Example progression: Em7 - Am7**

Practice this pattern over the progression until it grooves.

**Exercise 3: Reggae Upstroke**

Reggae emphasizes the off-beats with upstrokes:

**Pattern:**
```
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
        U       U       U
```

Use a progression like C - G - Am - F and play ONLY upstrokes on the off-beats. Palm mute lightly for the classic reggae sound.

**Exercise 4: Dynamics Practice**

Take a simple progression (C - F - G - C) and play it 4 different ways:

**Round 1:** All quiet (pp - pianissimo)
**Round 2:** Medium volume (mf - mezzo forte)
**Round 3:** Loud (ff - fortissimo)
**Round 4:** Dynamic swell (start quiet, build to loud, back to quiet)

Control your dynamics consciously.

**Exercise 5: Rhythm & Chord Changes**

The real challenge: changing chords while maintaining rhythm.

**Progression: C - Am - Dm - G**

**Step 1:** Change chords on beat 1 of each measure (slow)
- C (4 beats) - Am (4 beats) - Dm (4 beats) - G (4 beats)

**Step 2:** Change every 2 beats
- C (2 beats) - Am (2 beats) - Dm (2 beats) - G (2 beats)

**Step 3:** Change every beat (advanced)
- C (1 beat) - Am (1 beat) - Dm (1 beat) - G (1 beat)

Maintain consistent rhythm while changing chords cleanly.

**Exercise 6: Arpeggiation**

Playing chord tones one at a time creates a different rhythmic texture:

**C Major Arpeggio:**
```
1   2   3   4
E   G   C   E   (ascending)
```

Practice arpeggios over progressions:
- C - Am - F - G
- Play each chord as an arpeggio (bass note first, then fill in)

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop rhythmic awareness and the ability to feel different grooves.

**Exercise 1: Clapping Rhythms**

Before playing, clap rhythms:

**Rhythm 1:**
```
1   2   3   4
X   X   X   X
```

**Rhythm 2:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
X   X   X   X
```

**Rhythm 3:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
X   X X   X   X
```

Clap accurately, then play them on guitar.

**Exercise 2: Rhythm Dictation**

Listen to a song and focus ONLY on the rhythm guitar:
1. Identify the time signature (4/4, 3/4, 6/8?)
2. Identify the strumming pattern
3. Notice accents and dynamics
4. Try to replicate it

**Songs with clear rhythm:**
- "Brown Eyed Girl" - Van Morrison (down-up strumming)
- "Wonderwall" - Oasis (specific fingerpicked pattern)
- "No Woman No Cry" - Bob Marley (reggae off-beat)

**Exercise 3: Groove Recognition**

Listen to different genres and feel the groove:

**Rock:** Strong backbeat (accents on 2 and 4)
- Example: "Back in Black" - AC/DC

**Funk:** Syncopated, lots of dead strums
- Example: "Superstition" - Stevie Wonder

**Reggae:** Off-beat emphasis
- Example: "Three Little Birds" - Bob Marley

**Blues Shuffle:** Triplet feel (swing)
- Example: "Pride and Joy" - Stevie Ray Vaughan

Identify which groove is being used in different songs.

**Exercise 4: Internal Clock Development**

1. Set metronome to 120 BPM
2. Play a rhythm for 8 bars
3. Turn off metronome
4. Continue playing for 8 bars (using your internal clock)
5. Turn metronome back on
6. Check if you're still in time

This develops your internal sense of tempo.

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

**Session 1:**
- Minutes 0-20: Theory - rhythm fundamentals, note values
- Minutes 20-50: Exercise 1 - metronome training (all steps)
- Minutes 50-70: Ear training - clapping rhythms
- Minutes 70-90: Application - learn rhythm part of a song

**Session 2:**
- Minutes 0-25: Exercise 2 & 3 - funk strum, reggae upstroke
- Minutes 25-55: Practice grooves over progressions
- Minutes 55-75: Ear training - rhythm dictation, groove recognition
- Minutes 75-90: Free play - experiment with different strumming patterns

**Session 3:**
- Minutes 0-30: Exercise 4, 5, 6 - dynamics, chord changes, arpeggiation
- Minutes 30-60: Integration - play through 3 songs focusing ONLY on rhythm
- Minutes 60-80: Ear training - internal clock development
- Minutes 80-90: Reflection - record yourself, listen for timing issues

### Checkpoint
By the end of Week 11, you should be able to:
- [ ] Play in time with a metronome consistently
- [ ] Execute at least 3 different strumming patterns
- [ ] Use dynamics (loud/soft) consciously
- [ ] Play syncopated rhythms
- [ ] Identify time signatures by ear
- [ ] Recognize different grooves (rock, funk, reggae, blues)
- [ ] Change chords smoothly while maintaining rhythm

### The Rhythm Guitarist's Mindset

Remember: The rhythm guitarist is the foundation. Bass and drums lock in with YOU. If your rhythm is shaky, the whole band suffers.

**Great rhythm playing is:**
- Consistent
- Groovy
- Dynamically interesting
- In service of the song

**Bad rhythm playing is:**
- Rushing or dragging
- Monotonous (no dynamics)
- Sloppy chord changes
- Ignoring the groove

Focus on being a rock-solid rhythm player. It's more important than flashy solos.

## WEEK 12: Composition Basics - Creating Your Own Music

### What You'll Learn
This is it - the culmination of everything you've learned. This week, you'll take all your knowledge (scales, chords, progressions, rhythm, improvisation) and use it to create original music. You'll learn basic songwriting and compositional techniques.

### Theory Concepts

**What is Composition?**

Composition is the art of organizing musical elements (melody, harmony, rhythm, form) into a coherent piece.

**The Basic Song Structure:**

Most songs follow recognizable forms:

**Verse-Chorus Form:**
- **Verse:** Tells the story, changes lyrically each time
- **Chorus:** The main hook, repeated with same lyrics
- **Bridge:** Contrasting section, usually appears once

**Common structures:**
- **ABABCB:** Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus
- **AABA:** Verse-Verse-Bridge-Verse (older songs, jazz standards)

**Melody Writing Principles:**

**1. Contour (Shape):**
Melodies have shapes - they go up, down, or stay level.

**Good melodies have:**
- A clear highest point (climax)
- A mix of steps (moving to adjacent notes) and leaps (jumping intervals)
- A sense of direction (not random)

**2. Rhythm:**
Melody is as much about rhythm as pitch. Vary note lengths.

**3. Repetition with Variation:**
Repeat a melodic idea, then vary it slightly. This creates familiarity + interest.

**Example:**
- Phrase 1: C - D - E - G (ascending)
- Phrase 2: C - D - E - A (same start, different ending)

**4. Question and Answer:**
Create tension (question), then resolve (answer).

**Example in C major:**
- Question: C - D - E - F - G (ends on dominant)
- Answer: C - D - E - D - C (ends on tonic - resolved)

**Harmony & Chord Progressions for Composition:**

**1. Start with a Progression:**
Pick a chord progression (from what you've learned):
- I - V - vi - IV (very common)
- I - IV - V (classic)
- vi - IV - I - V (emotional)

**2. Create Melodic Interest:**
Your melody should:
- Emphasize chord tones on strong beats
- Use passing tones for motion
- Contrast between sections (verse melody vs. chorus melody)

**Form and Contrast:**

**Verse:** Often lower in range, more conversational
**Chorus:** Higher in range, more energetic, memorable hook
**Bridge:** Different chord progression, provides contrast

**Example:**
- **Verse:** Progression in lower register, minor feel
- **Chorus:** Same key but major chords, higher melody
- **Bridge:** Briefly modulate to relative minor or IV

**Dynamics and Arrangement:**

Think beyond just chords and melody:
- **Intro:** Set the mood (often instrumental)
- **Verse 1:** Start softer, build
- **Chorus:** Louder, fuller sound
- **Verse 2:** Pull back slightly
- **Chorus 2:** Same energy as Chorus 1
- **Bridge:** Change dynamics (softer or heavier)
- **Final Chorus:** Biggest, most intense
- **Outro:** Wind down or end abruptly

**Lyrics and Melody Relationship:**

If you're writing lyrics:
- **Strong syllables** should land on strong beats
- **Rhyme scheme** should feel natural (AABB, ABAB, ABCB)
- **Melody follows natural speech patterns**

### Guitar Application

**Exercise 1: Chord Progression Creation**

Create 3 original progressions:

**Progression 1: Bright and Happy (Major Key)**
- Use I, IV, V, vi
- Example: C - F - Am - G

**Progression 2: Dark and Moody (Minor Key)**
- Use i, iv, VI, VII
- Example: Am - Dm - F - G

**Progression 3: Experimental (Borrowed Chords)**
- Mix major and minor
- Example: C - Fm - Ab - G (borrowing from C minor)

Play each progression until you can change chords smoothly.

**Exercise 2: Melody Over Chords**

Take Progression 1 (C - F - Am - G):

**Step 1:** Hum/sing a simple melody over it
**Step 2:** Figure out that melody on guitar (one note at a time)
**Step 3:** Write it down (scale degrees or actual notes)
**Step 4:** Refine - does it start and end on the root? Does it have a climax?

Do this for all 3 progressions.

**Exercise 3: Form Construction**

Build a simple song structure:

**Verse (8 bars):** Progression 1, quieter dynamics
**Chorus (8 bars):** Progression 1, louder dynamics, different melody
**Verse 2 (8 bars):** Same as Verse 1
**Chorus 2 (8 bars):** Same as Chorus 1
**Bridge (4 bars):** Progression 2 (contrast)
**Chorus 3 (8 bars):** Final chorus, biggest dynamics

Practice playing through this form smoothly.

**Exercise 4: Rhythm and Arrangement**

Take your chord progressions and add rhythmic variation:

**Verse:** Arpeggiated (fingerpicked)
**Chorus:** Strummed (full chords)
**Bridge:** Simpler rhythm (half-note strums for space)

This creates dynamic contrast between sections.

**Exercise 5: Complete Composition**

Combine everything:

**Your Task:** Write a 2-minute instrumental piece with:
- Intro (4 bars)
- Verse (8 bars)
- Chorus (8 bars)
- Verse 2 (8 bars)
- Chorus 2 (8 bars)
- Bridge (4 bars)
- Final Chorus (8 bars)
- Outro (4 bars)

Use original chord progressions and melodies. Vary dynamics and rhythm.

**Record yourself playing it.**

### Ear Training

**Your Mission This Week:**
Develop the ability to hear and analyze song structures.

**Exercise 1: Form Analysis**

Pick 3 songs you know and map out the structure:

**Example: "Let It Be" - The Beatles**
- Intro (4 bars) - Piano
- Verse 1 (8 bars)
- Chorus (8 bars)
- Verse 2 (8 bars)
- Chorus (8 bars)
- Bridge/Solo (8 bars)
- Verse 3 (8 bars)
- Chorus (8 bars)
- Outro (fade out)

Do this for:
- A rock song
- A pop song
- A ballad

Notice how they structure their songs for maximum impact.

**Exercise 2: Melodic Contour Recognition**

Listen to melodies and draw their shape:

**"Happy Birthday":**
```
      /\
     /  \
    /    \___
   /
```
(Goes up, peaks, comes down, stays level, goes up again)

Draw the contour of 3 melodies you know.

**Exercise 3: Harmonic Function Listening**

Listen to a song and identify:
- When does it feel "at home" (tonic)?
- When does it feel like it needs to resolve (dominant)?
- When does it feel like it's building tension (subdominant)?

This helps you understand why certain progressions work.

**Exercise 4: Transcribe a Simple Song**

Pick an extremely simple song (children's song, folk song):
1. Figure out the chords by ear
2. Figure out the melody
3. Write down both
4. Analyze: What key? What scale? What chord progression?

**Example songs:**
- "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
- "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"
- "Amazing Grace"

### Practice Session Structure (90 minutes)

# FINAL THOUGHTS

**Music theory is a tool, not a cage.**

It's meant to liberate you, not constrain you. Use it to understand what you play, to communicate with other musicians, and to express yourself more fully.

But never forget: **Music is sound.** It's emotional. It's human.

The goal isn't to memorize formulas - it's to internalize the language of music so deeply that you can speak it fluently, without thinking.

**Trust your ears. Play with your heart. Study with your mind.**

And most importantly: **Keep playing.**
